# LimaDeveloper

My portifolio website inspired by tiling window managers, built with **React**, **Tailwind CSS**, and a glassy window layout. Each window acts as a tile that contains information about skills, contact, and projects.

## ✨ Features

* **Tiling Window Manager UI** – Multiple windows arranged like a WM desktop.
* **Workspace Switcher** – Tabs at the top for different workspaces.
* **Terminal-style Panel** – Fake `neofetch` with personal details.
* **Glassmorphism Styling** – Transparent, blurred window effects.
* **Responsive Design** – Works on desktop and mobile.
